<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<li>Basic characteristics of IDF are explained with its applications.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<li>The visible appearance of the flame can be divided broadly into two zones <br /> (i) Blue zone <br /> (ii) Luminous zone.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<li>The blue zone height increases with MR together with a reduction in luminous zone height. This can be attributed to the better entrainment and mixing of annular jet by intense turbulence generated by the central air jet.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<li>A linear empirical relationship is obtained between the non-dimensional flame height and MR which will be useful in the preliminary design of compact IDF based combustion systems.</li>
