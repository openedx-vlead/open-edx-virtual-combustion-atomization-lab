<p style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-family: calibri;"> <span style="font-size: 1.5em;"> QNX is a commercial Unix-like real-time operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems. As a microkernel-based OS, QNX is based on the idea of running most of the OS in the form of a number of small tasks, known as servers. This differs from the more traditional monolithic kernel, in which the operating system is a single very large program composed of a huge number of "parts" with special abilities. </span> </span></p>
