<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<li>To provide access to the advanced combustion experimentations to both the under-graduate and post-graduate students of other colleges in India.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br />
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<li>To expose the students and motivate them by creating an opportunity to the advanced experiments which are usually not available for other engineering colleges.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br />
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<li>To incorporate animations of underlying process and intricate phenomena during experimentations to make the student appreciate and develop better understanding of the fundamental concepts.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br />
<ul style="color: #cc3300;">
<li>Hence, through this virtual lab, the students from other engineering colleges will be benefited both conceptually and practically.</li>
